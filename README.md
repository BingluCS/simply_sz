## Introduction:

SZ is a error-bounded lossy compressor based prediction model for HPC data. This project contains only the one-dimensional floating-point data compression procedure of SZ2 to help users understand the basic principles of SZ2.

## Fundamentalï¼š

The SZ2 first predict current data according to the former data to have been traversed.
